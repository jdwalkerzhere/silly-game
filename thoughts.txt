when you drop a letter it could
1. cause a match and you need to destroy that match, drop all letters above it, and destroy any downstream matches and drop their downstream letters above
2. nothing

when you need to destroy a match, you need to
1. check if there's anything above it
    a. if so you need to continue to look up and see how many letters to drop
        - if you hit 0 on the y axis you just replace with a "_"
        - if you hit "_" as the value, you can stop
        - if you hit any letter, you need to bring it into your cell
    b. if not you can just replace your cell with "_" and continue on
